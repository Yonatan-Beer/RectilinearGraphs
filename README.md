Rectilinear Graphs is a tool created to assist reasoning about the number of crossing of various configurations of graphs with straight edges. It is entirely the work of Yonatan Beer. Rectilinear Graphs is written in Rust using the egui framework. This is a work in progress, and as such many basic functionalities are still being added.
